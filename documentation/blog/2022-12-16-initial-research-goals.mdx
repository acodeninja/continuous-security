*Project Pitch*

In this post I will go over the target users of my project, stating hypotheses that I will use to guide my initial user
research. I shall use this research to further refine the overall goal of the project and to further expand the final
product's requirements.

## User Research Cycle

For this project I shall adopt hypothesis driven design approach. This will involve generating a list of provable
hypotheses, conducting research to test them, and then refining the requirements to meet the findings of my research.
During the course of the project I shall revisit these hypotheses should I not gain enough knowledge to generate
requirements from them.

In order to be successful I must first identify users and their interactions with the system. Once interactions are
identified, I can then follow the cycle detailed above.

## Users

Users are those that directly interact with the system, either by providing inputs or by viewing and interpreting
outputs. In my initial project idea I documented two groups of [users][internal:project-idea:users]: developers and
decision makers.

### Developers

> Software Developers will configure the software, and as the project aims to reduce the time taken to accomplish this,
> they are users.

*Extract from [initial project idea][internal:project-idea]*

Developers interact with the system during a number of activities.

* Configuring the system to scan an application for vulnerabilities.
* Interpreting the report output to develop mitigations for found vulnerabilities.
* Understanding how vulnerabilities are introduced into the application.


### Decision Makers

Decision makers use the security report produced by the system to make well-informed decisions to prioritise and
discuss vulnerabilities present in the application. Decision makers can be delivery managers, product owners or other
stakeholders of the application that reside outside the team. They interact with the system via it's output reports and
by deciding the prioritisation of vulnerability mitigation.

* Interpret the report output to understand the potential impact of vulnerabilities in the application.
* Interpret the report output to decide on the priority of mitigating each vulnerability.
* Understand how vulnerabilities are introduced into the application.


## Ideation

Based on the users interactions and stakeholder requirements explored above, I have generated a number of initial
hypotheses. These are not set in stone and will likely be altered and refined further as the first round of research is
conducted.

### Support

Concerned with the types of projects and analysis the system supports.

* [S1](#hypothesis-S1) Developers need the system to support static analysis of code.
* [S2](#hypothesis-S2) Developers need the system to support dynamic analysis of a running web application.
* [S3](#hypothesis-S3) Developers need the system to support auditing of third party libraries used in their application.

### Environment

Concerned with the environment in which developers will run scans and the environments those scans will target.

* [E1](#hypothesis-E1) Developers need to scan applications locally.
* [E2](#hypothesis-E2) Developers need to perform dynamic scans of applications running in a pre-production environment.
* [E3](#hypothesis-E3) Developers need to scan applications as part of a continuous integration or deployment pipeline.

### Configuration

Concerned with how developers will configure the system to run scans.

* [C1](#hypothesis-C1) Developers find configuration of current security analysis tools complex.
* Developers will want to include the scanning configuration for their application alongside its code.
* Developers will want to configure scanning using a configuration language they and team members are familiar with.

### Reporting

Concerned with the outputs of the system and what users need to gain value from using it.

* Developers will need details of which specific components of their application are vulnerable to attack.
* Developers will need reports of vulnerabilities raised in the issue tracking system in use by their project team.
* Developers will need examples in order to manually test their application for a detected vulnerability.
* Developers will need reports to include details of recurring vulnerabilities that have previously been detected.
* Decision makers will need the report to include an executive summary that explains the overall security of the
    application.
* Decision makers will need the report to explain the impact of vulnerabilities in a non-technical way.
* Decision makers will need the report to explain how a vulnerability was introduced into the system.

### Licensing, Legal and Ethical

Concerned with how the software in use is licensed and what legal restrictions exist.

* All users will need confidence that the system and it's components are distributed legally.
* All users will need confidence that their use case for the system does not break the law or software licensing.

## Concretion

Here I shall further investigate the established hypotheses, stating my falsification and listing any queries I may use
to falsify each hypothesis.

                },
            ]} />

Initially I shall conduct quantitative research to survey statistics from prospective users of the application. Some
hypotheses lend themselves to qualitative research but at this stage I do not have enough overall knowledge to
get good value from qualitative user research.

### Support

> Developers will need the system to support analysing code written in their application's language.

In order to explore this I must first understand which languages are in wide use by the public sector in both local and
central government. Knowing this will allow me to better shape further research around this hypothesis.

#### Queries

There are a number of queries I can use to explore the use of programming languages in government.

* Conduct a review of open source projects in government.
    * Use GitHub organisations as a starting point.
        * [DLUHC][web:github:dluhc]
        * [MOJ][web:github:moj]
        * [GCHQ][web:github:gchq]
        * [GDS][web:github:gds]
    * Query with civil servant developer colleagues I have worked with on which languages they have used.
    * Query with colleagues who have and are currently working on public services.
* Include a question in survey of developers at my organisation asking which languages they have used when working on
    government deliveries.
