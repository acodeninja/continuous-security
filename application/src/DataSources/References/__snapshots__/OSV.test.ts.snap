"### Impact

Mautic allows you to track open rates by using tracking pixels. 
The tracking information is stored together with extra metadata of the tracking request.

The output isn't sufficiently filtered when showing the metadata of the tracking information, which may lead to a vulnerable situation.

### Patches

Please upgrade to 4.3.0

### Workarounds
None.

### References
* Internally tracked under MST-38
